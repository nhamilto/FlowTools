Description: # FlowTools
        FlowTools is a python package designed for the analysis of fluid flow data, including  of turbulent fluid dynamics and wind energy. The main object class in FlowTools is the FlowField class. All other other functions operate on instances of this class. FlowField requires two inputs: (1) velocities - a dict containing instantaneous velocities u, v, w, of a common size, (2) coordinates - a dict containing the coordinates, x, y, z, t, of the data.
        
        ## Getting Started
        FlowTools does not include an data i/o, and requires that the user load data and format it correctly before constructing a FlowField object. Load data and arrange it into dicts of np.arrays where each array has a common shape.
        
        ## Required packages
        numpy - used to structure data into arrays, perform basic operations, etc.
        matplotlib - used in flow visualization
        file i/o - some sort of data importing and exporting utilities. Will depend on the particular data of interest (csv, h5py, etc.)
        
        ## Prerequisites
        Python 3.6 - working knowledge
        
        ## Installing
        Download or clone git repo. Go to town.
        
        ## Example usage:
        ```
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import FlowTools as ft
        
        #%% load data and make dictionaries for velocity and coordinates
        indat = h5py.File('testdata.csv')
        
        u = np.asarray(indat['u'])
        v = np.asarray(indat['v'])
        w = np.asarray(indat['w'])
        x = np.asarray(indat['x'])
        y = np.asarray(indat['y'])
        z = np.asarray(indat['z'])
        timevec = np.asarray(indat['t'])
        
        velocities = {'u': u,
        'v': v,
        'w': w}
        
        coordinates = {'x': x,
        'y': y,
        'z': z,
        't': timevec}
        # create FlowField object
        testflow = ft.FlowField(velocities, coordinates)
        # print object attributes
        testflow.who()
        ```
        
        
        ## Version
        The current version of the package is v.0.0.
